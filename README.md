# Blend-sonic
## make sound with graphics

Blend-sonic is a new way to use Sonic Pi and sync to the 3D Blender scene. 

Blend-sonic has been designed with the aim to make Sonic Pi easy to write and play with.
This let you connect sound events(Sonic PI programs) to 3D object actions/animations in Blender.

Blend-sonic is made out of 
* a small [Blender](https://blender.org). plugin/addon that take care of the OSC comuication with Sonic PI
* visual nodes that use the  [Animation Nodes](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes) addon to build 
a [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi) program

### what is Sonic PI?

[Sonic Pi](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi) is a complete open source programming environment originally
designed to explore and *teach programming concepts* within schools through
the process of creating *new sounds*.

In addition to being an engaging education resource it has evolved into
an *extremely powerful* and performance-ready *live coding instrument* suitable
for professional artists and DJs.

### what is Blender?
A powerful 3D program that render even the music if you ask it to... :)
