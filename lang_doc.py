    "summary": "Send an OSC message (Open Sound Control)",

This can be sent from within Sonic Pi by writing:\n`osc \\\"/set/filter\\\", \\\"lowpass\\\", 80, 0.5`\nHowever, in order to send the OSC message you must first specify where to send it to. This is achieved by specifying both the host (the machine's internet address) and the port that the remote OSC server is listening on. This is configured using `use_osc` or `with_osc`. So, if our synth program was running on a machine on the local network with IP address `10.0.1.5` on port `5100` we could send our OSC message to it with the following:\n`use_osc \\\"10.0.1.5\\\", 5100`\n`osc \\\"/set/filter\\\", \\\"lowpass\\\", 80, 0.5`\nNote, by default, Sonic Pi listens for OSC messages on port `4560`, so you may send messages to an external machine running Sonic Pi if you know the IP address of that external machine. Any OSC messages received on port `4559` are automatically converted to standard cue events and displayed in the GUI's cue log. This also means that you can use `sync` to wait for the next incoming OSC message with a given path (see example).\nFinally, it is also very useful to send OSC messages to aother programs on the same computer. This can be achieved by specifying \\\"localhost\\\" as the hostname and the port as normal (depending on which port the other program is listening on).\nSee `osc_send` for a version which allows you to specify the hostname and port directly (ignoring any values set via `use_osc` or `with_osc`).\nFor further information see the OSC spec: [http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0](http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0)\n",

  "time_warp": {
    "summary": "Shift time forwards or backwards for the given block",
    "doc": "The code within the given block is executed with the specified delta time shift specified in beats. For example, if the delta value is 0.1 then all code within the block is executed with a 0.1 beat delay. Negative values are allowed which means you can move a block of code *backwards in time*. For example a delta value of -0.1 will execute the code in the block 0.1 beats ahead of time. The time before the block started is restored after the execution of the block.\nGiven a list of times, run the block once after waiting each given time. If passed an optional params list, will pass each param individually to each block call. If size of params list is smaller than the times list, the param values will act as rings (rotate through). If the block is given 1 arg, the times are fed through. If the block is given 2 args, both the times and the params are fed through. A third block arg will receive the index of the time.\nNote that the code within the block is executed synchronously with the code before and after, so all thread locals will be modified inline - as is the case for `with_fx`. However, as time is always restored to the value before `time_warp` started, you can use it to schedule events for the future in a similar fashion to a thread (via `at` or `in_thread`) without having to use an entirely fresh and distinct set of thread locals - see examples.\nAlso, note that you cannot travel backwards in time beyond the `current_sched_ahead_time`.\nIf the `time_warp` block is within a `density` block, the delta time is not affected (although all the other times such as sleep and phase durations will be affected) - see example.\n`time_warp` is ahead-of-time scheduling within the current thread. See `at` for just-in-time scheduling using multiple isolated threads.",

  "live_loop": {
    "summary": "A loop for live coding",
    "doc": "Loop the do/end block forever. However, unlike a basic loop, a live_loop has two special properties. Firstly it runs in a thread - so you can have any number of live loops running at the same time (concurrently). Secondly, you can change the behaviour of a live loop whilst it is still running without needing to stop it. Live loops are therefore the secret to live coding with Sonic Pi.\nAs live loops are excecuted within a named in_thread, they behave similarly. See the in_thread documentation for all the details. However, it's worth mentioning a few important points here. Firstly, only one live loop with a given name can run at any one time. Therefore, if you define two or more `live_loop`s called `:foo` only one will be running. Another important aspect of `live_loop`s is that they manage their own thread locals set with the `use_*` and `with_*` fns. This means that each `live_loop` can have its own separate default synth, BPM and sample defaults. When a `live_loop` is *first* created, it inherits the thread locals from the parent thread, but once it has started, the only way to change them is by re-defining the do/end body of the `live_loop`. See the examples below for details. Finally, as mentioned above, provided their names are different, you may have many `live_loop`s executing at once.\nA typical way of live coding with live loops is to define a number of them in a buffer, hit Run to start them and then to modify their do/end blocks and then hit Run again. This will not create any more thread, but instead just modify the behaviour of the existing threads. The changes will *not* happen immediately. Instead, they will only happen the next time round the loop. This is because the behaviour of each live loop is implemented with a standard function. When a live loop is updated, the function definition is also updated. Each time round the live loop, the function is called, so the new behviour is only observed next time round the loop.\nAlso sends a `cue` with the same name each time the `live_loop` repeats. This may be used to `sync` with other threads and `live_loop`s.\nIf the `live_loop` block is given a parameter, this is given the result of the last run of the loop (with initial value either being `0` or an init arg). This allows you to 'thread' values across loops.\nFinally, it is possible to delay the initial trigger of the live_loop on creation with both the `delay:` and `sync:` opts. See their respective docstrings. If both `delay:` and `sync:` are specified, on initial live_loop creation first the delay will be honoured and then the sync.\n",

  "sample": {
    "summary": "Trigger sample",
    "doc": "Play back a recorded sound file (sample). Sonic Pi comes with lots of great samples included (see the section under help) but you can also load and play `.wav`, `.wave`, `.aif`, `.aiff`, `.ogg`, `.oga` or `.flac` files from anywhere on your computer too. To play a built-in sample use the corresponding keyword such as `sample :bd_haus`. To play any file on your computer use a full path such as `sample \\\"/path/to/sample.wav\\\"`.\nThere are many opts for manipulating the playback. For example, the `rate:` opt affects both the speed and the pitch of the playback. To control the rate of the sample in a pitch-meaningful way take a look at the `rpitch:` opt.\nThe sampler synth has three separate envelopes - one for amplitude, one for a low pass filter and another for a high pass filter. These work very similar to the standard synth envelopes except for two major differences. Firstly, the envelope times do not stretch or shrink to match the BPM. Secondly, the sustain time by default stretches to make the envelope fit the length of the sample. This is explained in detail in the tutorial.\nSamples are loaded on-the-fly when first requested (and subsequently remembered). If the sample loading process takes longer than the schedule ahead time, the sample trigger will be skipped rather than be played late and out of time. To avoid this you may preload any samples you wish to work with using `load_sample` or `load_samples`.\nIt is possible to set the `start:` and `finish:` positions within the sample to play only a sub-section of it. These values can be automatically chosen based on an onset detection algorithm which will essentially isolate each individual drum or synth hit in the sample and let you access each one by an integer index (floats will be rounded to the nearest integer value). See the `onset:` docstring and examples for more information.\nFinally, the sampler supports a powerful filtering system to make it easier to work with large folders of samples. The filter commands must be used before the first standard opt. There are six kinds of filter parameters you may use:\n1. Folder strings - `\\\"/foo/bar\\\"` - which will add all samples within the folder to the set of candidates.\n2. Recursive folder strings - `\\\"/foo/bar/**\\\"` - Folder strings ending with `**` will add all samples contained within all subfolders (searched recursively).\n3. Sample strings - `\\\"/path/to/sample.wav\\\"` - which will add the specific sample to the set of candidates.\n4. Other strings - `\\\"foobar\\\"` - which will filter the candidates based on whether the filename contains the string.\n5. Regular expressions - `/b[aA]z.*/` - which will filter the candidates based on whether the regular expression matches the filename.\n6. Keywords - `:quux` - will filter the candidates based on whether the keyword is a direct match of the filename (without extension).\n7. Numbers - `0` - will select the candidate with that index (wrapping round like a ring if necessary).\n8. Lists of the above - `[\\\"/foo/bar\\\", \\\"baz\\\", /0-9.*/]` - will recurse down and work through the internal filter parameters as if they were in the top level.\n9. Lambdas - `lambda {|s| [s.choose] }` - the ultimate power tool for filters. Allows you to create a custom fn which receives a list of candidates as an arg and which should return a new list of candidates (this may be smaller, larger, re-ordered it's up to you).\nBy combining commands which add to the candidates and then filtering those candidates it is possible to work with folders full of samples in very powerful ways. Note that the specific ordering of filter parameters is irrelevant with the exception of the numbers - in which case the last number is the index. All the candidates will be gathered first before the filters are applied.\n",

It needs to be around 0.2 (200ms) or greater for pitched sounds like guitar or bass, and needs to be around 0.02 (20ms) or lower for percussive sounds like drum loops.

Equivalent to automatically turning the amp down when the signal gets too loud and then back up again when it's quiet.
